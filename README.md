OSM2VectorTiles makes is possible to create vector tiles from OpenStreetMap data. For a detailed documentation, please visit our [project website](http://osm2vectortiles.org/docs/).

Create a custom base map in minutes with our free vector tiles from [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org) data. 
This is the easiest way how to switch to OSM thanks to [MapBox](https://github.com/mapbox) open-source tools. Design your own map of world or country, serve raster or vector tiles from any virtual server or your own infrastructure, even offline behind a firewall.
